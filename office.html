<H1> Frank Filz's Office </H1>

<p>My office serves as my work from home office (I'm a full time remote employee), my gaming room, and my Lego hobby room
(shared with our two girls). I did almost no cleanup for these pictures, what you see is what it typically looks like
most of the time (while I am actively building Lego it gets much messier with bins of Lego all around my desk, also if
the kids are playing, they will have Lego all over the floor).

<p>The thumbnails below are links to image hosting on Brickshelf, from there, you can navigate among the pictures or click
on an image to see a full resolution version.

Another angle towards the desk. This gives a good view of the major Lego storage at the back of the room.

<p>Next I will show closeups of the back part of the room with my desk, starting from the left and ending with the desk:

There is a small work table opposite my desk. When I am working on a large Lego project this would be the worktable.
Other times it has papers (sorry, I cleared my bills off before taking pictures...) and various parts of my Lego sorting
system.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654349"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=

&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
Under the worktable is storage for laptop bags, gaming stuff for the games I'm currently running, some miscellaneous
computer stuff and a drawer with some small Lego parts containers. The games currently represented here are D&D (AD&D 1e
and BX with Judges Guild's Wilderlands of High Fantasy setting materials), Classic Traveller, and RuneQuest.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654351"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=128  ALT=file SRC=

Behind the worktable are some bins of Lego parts.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654352"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=

&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
Here's all the stuff that was behind the worktable. The stack of snap together bins (Sterlite brand) contain carriages,
wagons, boats, and dragons for my Lego castle display. The big tub contains bags of overflow parts for the small parts
drawers in the other half of the room.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654356"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=

Under the worktable are organizers to hold Lego instructions.

And under the end of the worktable is this bookcase filled with unopened Lego sets.

<p>The wall behind the worktable has three bookcases, with Lego stacked on top of all three.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654353"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=128  ALT=file SRC=

The top shelf is most of my RuneQuest material (well, there are 3 other sections in the room). Under that are
a bunch of Snapware Snap 'N Stack bins that hold Lego castle minifigs sorted by faction or type. Below that is my
complete run of Dungeon Magazine.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654354"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=

Below that is a shelf with mostly computer books but some gaming and some Lego.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654355"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=

The top sheld of the 2nd bookcase is Plano tackle boxes with small Lego parts. Below that is a shelf of Lego instructions
and graphic novels (Asterix & Obelix, Tintin, and a few others). Next are two shelves with Sterlite drawer units with
various Lego parts, wit one drawer having office stuff and another having scrap paper). The bottom shelf is another shelf
of Plano tackle boxes with small Lego parts.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654358"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=128  ALT=file SRC=

&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
The third bookcase has gaming stuff on the top shelf (overflow RuneQuest and other Chaosium games, D&D boxed sets (with
the Master box having the BECM and a few other books, the Expert box has B and X modules, and the Companion box has random
other stuff), D&D modules, Blackmoor setting, more Wilderlands setting, other random gaming stuff, and more Traveller stuff.
The next shelf has more Snapware Stack 'N Snap with Lego castle minifigs, a bin of Lego magazines, and some instructions.
The next two shelves have smaller Plano tackle boxes and more drawer units all with Lego parts. The bottom shelf has more
large Plano tackle boxes with Lego parts and minifig parts, and my 35mm slide projector and slides.

<p>You can also start to see the Lego storage on the back wall.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654360"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=128  ALT=file SRC=

Half of the Lego storage on the back wall.

The top half of the other half. There are also four 1/3 height sets of drawers on casters.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654366"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=128  ALT=file SRC=

And a better view of the storage on the back wall without the mobile units in front of it (sorry, hard to get the
bottom with the desk in the way).

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654368"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=

So here's the bottom drawers.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654365"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=

And here's my desk. Ordinarilly there are two laptops, you can see the power brick and docking station for the second,
but it's off for repairs at the time of this picture, it literally went up in smoke. Against the wall are shelves, with
the top shelf mostly occupied by Lego books, but there is a small section of RuneQuest books. The magazine files hold
tax information and stuff like that and 2 years of Consumer Reports magazine. The next shelf has computer books and
Traveller boxed sets (with extra booklets inside) on the left, and original D&D plus supplements, Arduin Grimoire volumes
1-3, Burning Wheel, and a bit more computer stuff on the right. The rest of the stuff on the desk besides the pictures
and stacks of CDs (yea, I actually listed to CDs, though I now have almost all of my collection digitized) is miscellaneous
stuff.

Under the desk is a TV cart with more Lego and some Lego storage containers filled with minfig legs.

<p>Now for the front half of the room.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654369"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=

An overview shot.

<p>The painting of the leopard was gifted to me after we returned from our trip to Europe when I was 9. We had rented our
house out and the renters gifted the picture to me. It is one of my favorite pieces of art. Another favorite is the Lego
Space 1984 poster. Between those two is the first patent I was awarded.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654342"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=128  ALT=file SRC=

&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
After the filing cabinets, there is a TV cart with my Lego sorting system. And because people like to see how others
sort their Lego, some detail shots:

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654343"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=

&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
This tray (which is the box from Lego set 6600) is filled with sorting bins which are the plastic tubs that Trader Joe's
Non-Pareeils come in.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654345"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=

&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
And the second 6600 box with 12 more bins.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654346"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/ffilz/office-2020-06-02/thumb/img_5273.jpg_thumb.jpg></A><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>
&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
And then two Lego advent calendar trays for more sorting.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654347"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/ffilz/office-2020-06-02/thumb/img_5274.jpg_thumb.jpg></A><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>
&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
And two more advent calendar trays. I have a third pair but they are currently empty.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654348"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=

&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
And then more trays with parts. The two with "mushroom bins" are sorting, the other three are storage of miscellaneous
parts, some of which are destined to be listed on Bricklink for sale.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654339"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=128  ALT=file SRC=

&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
Next is my little CD collection and a bookshelf with miscellaneous books and some RPG books.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654341"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=128  ALT=file SRC=
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/ffilz/office-2020-06-02/thumb/img_5268.jpg_thumb.jpg></A><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>
&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
And then small parts drawers with small Lego pieces. The girls are often standing on an ottoman to reach these drawers
for their creations. Among the parts are tiles which they love to use to make mosaics.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654336"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=96  ALT=file SRC=

&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
This shows the corner of the room with the closet. The storage to the right of the closet door is miscellaneous paper
and gift wrapping supplies.

<p>Inside the closet:

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654333"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=128  ALT=file SRC=
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/ffilz/office-2020-06-02/thumb/img_5260.jpg_thumb.jpg></A><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>
&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
First is drawers of Lego parts I have up on Bricklink for sale. Also some unopened set storage (don't go looking for
those Chinese New Years sets on Bricklink, I'm not selling those, most of the other sets ARE for sale).

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654334"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=128  ALT=file SRC=
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/ffilz/office-2020-06-02/thumb/img_5261.jpg_thumb.jpg></A><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>
&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
Next is a bookcase with more gaming stuff and other stuff. The beat up cardboard box has my Different Worlds and
White Dwarf collection.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654335"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=128  ALT=file SRC=
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/ffilz/office-2020-06-02/thumb/img_5262.jpg_thumb.jpg></A><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>
&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
And the last shows what a disaster the closet is. Against the back are boxes of board games and RPGs. Along the right
wall are mailing supplies.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654340"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=128  ALT=file SRC=

&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
Next is a farm table that the kids use to build on. Behind is a bookcase mostly filled with model railroading books
and magazines (do I have too many hobbies?). Under the table is more wrapping supplies and a big box with dog beds and
stuff in case we get another dog.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=6654370"><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=128  ALT=file SRC=
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/ffilz/office-2020-06-02/thumb/img_5298.jpg_thumb.jpg></A><BR><FONT SIZE=-2>
&copy; Copyright 2020, Frank Filz</FONT><BR>
A better view of the bookcase.

<HR SIZE=6><P>

And that concludes the tour of my office.
