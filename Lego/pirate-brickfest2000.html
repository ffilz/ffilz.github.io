Some of the assembled pirate ships out on display Friday evening.
My Black Seas Barracuda is in the front,
with the Red Seas Barracuda to the left. You can see the pink sailed
ship of mine. The Carribbean Clipper, Cutter, and Red Beard's Runner in
the background are all Stephen Roberts's. The rest of the ships are mine
(and this is only about 1/3 of what I brought).

This looks like turn 1. People clockwise from the left are Jackie Lynch,
Chris Weeks, Stephen Roberts, Abe Friedman, Jameson, someone's legs, the
back of Shiri's head, Andy Lynch's legs. This is a nice picture of the
overall layout of the high seas. You can see most of the bases and
islands (the only things not visible are Stephen Campbell's fort and a
pirate base which would be off the bottom of the picture.

Here we are on turn 2 I think. Around the room clockwise starting in the upper
left are Stephen Roberts, Abe Friedman, Jameson,
Lindsay Braun, Tim Coutney, Shiri Dori, and Mike Shamus in the center. You can
see part of Jacky Lynch and Chris Week's legs. Andy
Lynch and Jeff Stembel are out of the picture (but that's Jeff's ship in the
lower left). Wanda and Colin are captaining (and 1st
mating in the case of Colin - no, not his first time with a woman you dirty
minded person, Colin is the 1st Mate) the Rusty Bucket
which is just above Jeff's ship, also heading towards Skull Island.

<P>
You can see how nice the LEGO range sticks look in the pictures.

<P>
Just above Skull Island, you can see Weather Island, which utilized Chris's
playground. In front of Stephen is Dino Island (island
also supplied by Chris, Dino's by myself). To the left of Stephen is the 6277
Imperial Trading Post. Between Stephen and Abe is the
pirate base (6279). Behind Jameson is a neutral port, with <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/shiri_lego/Inn_done.html">Shiri's Bloodstone Inn</A>. Right in
front of Lindsay is 6276 Eldorado Fortress. Mike
and Tim are converging on a treasure island. Behind Mike is a native outpost.
Between Mike and Skull Island is another treasure
island. Another neutral port is between Jackie and Jeff off the left side of the
picture. Another pirate base is near Shiri, and
Stephen Cambel's Imperial base will show up in front (well in back of Hurricane
Shiri).

It looks like I'm on my way over to help Mike and Tim resolve combat. Shiri has just moved up to the merchant ship,

Shiri's ship, the Helfarrr, captained by Cap'n Scarrrr, is trying to chase down
the Imperial merchant ship, but due to a favorable
wind it will escape to the fog (I was also estimating distances so who knows if
it got a slight extra tailwind or not).

Looking over towards the Southern part of the ocean. Lindsay's ship is

Island is at the lower right corner. Starting from the left, going
clockwise, we have Tim Courtney showing off the great Brickfest 2000
T-Shirt. I'm helping Tim and Mike Shamus deal with a treasure island and
some natives. You can see the merchant that Shiri was chasing just
peeking above Tim, with the Helfarrr sailing out from behind Mike. I'm
not sure who the spectator sitting in the chair is. Stephen Campbell is
just starting to sail into the game. That's his fort that suffered from
Hurricane Shiri in front of him. Jeff Stembell and Jackie Lynch are
attacking Skull Island. Beside Jackie is Weather Island. Mike Shamus
is coming to Tim's aid in dealing with the natives. That's another
treasure island off Mike's knee.

The crew of the Rusty Bucket fire for effect, dismantling 3 skeletons on the
first volley. Marksman Colin (in the green suit and
blue cap) proved quite a good shot (he did after all get his start as a trapper
up in the Canadian woods [I gave many of the players
bonuses which were in some way tied to who they were, one of the possible bonuses
is American which gives a +2 with muskets]). Wanda
can be seen in the pirate hat in the back. Jeff's ship also fired a volley of
personal fire, and every shot missed, or passed
harmlessly through the skeletons (it's hard hitting them bones).

<H1>CRITIQUE</H1>
<P>
My first impressions:

<P>
Saturday morning saw us off to a slow start at setting up the pirate
game. I think it was 11 by the time we were ready to start. We had a
break for lunch and a few breaks for demos, and finally wound up at 6 PM
or so. We learned a lot about running the game (like it was a mistake to
only have one GM given the number of players Stephen had rounded up by
the time we were ready to start). There was also some confusion caused
by areas which the rules don't specify well (like dealing with aligators
on shore).

<P>
I also only got out three merchant ships. Captain Scar (played by Shiri
Dori) tried to capture the first ship, but was handicapped by a wind
direction favorable to the merchant and her starting position and she
never caught up with it. Lindsay managed to capture the 2nd ship. Two
players (Chris Weeks and Jeff Stembel I think) cooperated at the end to
capture the third ship. A pair of people (at least one of which was an
AFOL spouse, I didn't quite catch if they were a couple, or both spouses
of other AFOLs) played captain Wanda and first mate Colin. They had good
success at shooting skeletons (killing three on the first turn of
personal combat), and their ship eventually shared the plunder of
skeleton isle with Jeff Stembel's ship.

<P>
Chris Weeks was awarded the perseverence award for taking out an
aligator on dino island after much effort (and one lost crewman who
mistakenly ventured onto the island). Stephen's ship found a huge pink
chest of silks on dino island.

<P>
All in all, a good time was had with the pirate game, and hopefully in
the future I can streamline some of the things which slowed the game
down. I will definitely use at least one assistant in the future (though
I have some ideas to allow assistants to be more participatory than the
GM can be).

<H2>Issues</H2>
<P>
Several issues arose during the game.

<H3>Space:</H3>
<P>
Our space was somewhat limited, though we were able to make do. The biggest problem was that
we did't have the space overnight, so we were unable to set up Friday evening. Another problem was anemic
airconditioning.

<H3>Pacing/GMs:</H3>
<P>
When we started approaching readiness to play, there were only a few players, so I decided to
handle the GMing myself. By the time we actually started, Stephen Roberts's recruiting resulted in 11 players.
Having one GM for 11 players really slowed the game down. One thing which would help (and was done to a limited
extent) is to have experienced players help resolve some of the combat. Other things which would help pacing is
to make sure everyone understands the turn sequence, and that if they are not in conflict with anyone, they can
just move their ships (and needn't even necessarily plot movement).

<P>
One thought is to have the assistants have some NPC ships to run so they can be more active in the game than
just helping resolve combats.

<P>
Another pacing issue was for players who came into the game late. Stephen Campbell spent several turns just
getting into the action. Some way to drop them more into the thick of things would help.

<H3>NPC Ship Sequencing:</H3>
<P>
One problem was that I frequently forgot to move the NPC ships. Additionally, I sometimes
just estimated the distance they moved. This caused frustration for at least one player. One thing I forgot to
use was the initiative system which would have actually had all the NPC ships move first (until Lindsay captured
the merchant). Use of the pursuit rules might also have made a difference in Shiri's pursuit of the merchant.

<H3>Weather:</H3>
<P>
Almost the entire game was played under a light wind from the West. The weather system didn't allow
for frequent enough changes. Also, I think that the number of wind levels may be more than really necessary. A
light wind seems like it mostly just slows the game down (though it would make a difference if two ships were
battling it out, and reinforcements were on the way). Steve Jackson noted that the pre-generated weather chart he 
supplied had a few places where there were two identical entries together, which results in a slower weather change,
and we happened to be in that part of the chart, so that certainly was a contributing factor. I will be examining
the weather system to see what changes might be worthwhile.

<H3>Creatures:</H3>
<P>
The rules don't cover all the creatures, so I had to make up some stuff. I liked how I ran
the skeletons. The crocodiles/aligators were a pain on land though. The rules make them almost invincible. I will
be changing this so that when they are on land at least they are easier to kill (even in the water they should be,
they can't dive to avoid damage as easily as sharks can).

<H3>Young Players:</H3>
<P>
Young players (under say 12 or so) can be difficult to manage. They often are impatient, and may not always
accept losses.

<P>
My thoughts from a response to Steve Jackson's post about the Dragon Con game:

<P>
I'm definitely interested in ideas on how to resolve the issues around younger
players. You did mention they were helpful during setup. I suspect in general,
one is just going to have to set an age limit and then be prepared to deal
with the occaisional immature player (and there is nothing saying that player
won't be 20 - I've had some immature players in college). You may still be
able to let them help set up, but it may be best not to get their hopes up.

<P>
In a smaller game, the solution may be to set the younger players of in an
insulated corner, bordered by understanding players. Make sure there are some
interesting islands for the younger players to explore, and just hope they
don't cause too much disruption (the younger player in the Brickfest game
caused no disruption because she was exploring an island no one else was near).

<P>
Of course some young folk may not even become an issue. While we were setting
up the Brickfest game, there was one youngster who wanted to play. He just
commandeered one of the ships and sailed it around the play area. By the time
we actually started, his parents had taken him and left (they were just
dropping in). He was causing no disruption or damage, and seemed to be
enjoying himself, so I just let him be. I'm not sure what I would have done
had he wanted to play (one thing I probably would have done would have been to
talk to the parents and point out that we planned to play for quite some time,
and that while the game is open to some coming and going, it could present a
problem, and also explain that the game is certainly an adult type of game. I
would hope such discussion would get the parents figuring out how to lure
their child away from the game).

H3>Picture Taking:</H3>
<P>
Stephen Campbell mentioned a polaroid to take pictures of each player's ship to help in ID. Another thing which
would be nice for game writeups would be more pictures taken during the game (especially before movement for
each turn).

<H2>The Good In The Game</H2>
<P>
One thing which worked very well was the LEGO range sticks. I had forgotten to bring tape measures, so we crafted
a bunch of range sticks from LEGO. We used 4 studs to the inch (Lindsay has suggested 3 would be better, but I
feel that trimming the ranges of small arms fire would be painful). Due to the limited space, I did change the
no-penalty range for cannon fire from 24" to 18". The range sticks also look great in the pictures (and help give
scale since it is so easy to see the range markings). One thing which would be helpfull is some short range sticks
for use in personal combat. It was sometimes difficult to maneuver the range sticks in amongst the rigging of the ships.
