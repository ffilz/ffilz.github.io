The Classic Traveller Character Generator is a Java Script program originally written by Paul Gorman.
I have been contributing to it, and this web site links to and hosts my latest version. There are
source code links below.

<p>
This following link will roll a character up for you, you can hit refresh a few times looking for one you like. Cut and paste and e-mail or otherwise post to me.
This version has the latest fixes and enhancements I've been working on plus some options chosen to make things easier for my game.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~ffilz/Gaming/travellercharactergenerator.html?history=verbose&muster=split&personal=always&vehicles=1977">Classic Traveller Character Generator<a>
</ul>

<p>The options are documented in the sections below:

<h2>history</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>debug</b> - show all the rolls plus a few extra decision making steps
<li><b>verbose</b> - show all the rolls
<li><b>none</b> - don't show the history at all
<li><b>any other value</b> - results in a simplified history, the default
</ul>

<h2>service</h2>
Specify a preferred service instead of random.
<ul>
<li><b>navy</b>
<li><b>marines</b>
<li><b>army</b>
<li><b>scouts</b>
<li><b>merchants</b>
<li><b>other</b>
</ul>

<h2>minscore</h2>
<p>
Specify the minimum score for the preferred service (applies to the
random service if a preferred service is not specified). The score is
normally the enlistment bonus the character has for a particular service.
<p>
The selection algorithm normally takes the preferred service (random or using
the service option above) and starts with the enlistment bonus for that service.
It then checks each service in order, if the examined service has a higher enlistment
bonus that the currently selected service, it switches. If they are the same, there is
a 2D roll, 8+ switches.
<ul>
<li><b>0</b> - default value, score is calculated for each service as above
<li><b>1-3</b> - these values give a preference to the chosen service
<li><b>4</b> - since 4 is higher than the maximum enlistment bonus, the selected service
will be chosen for enlistment, the draft can still occur.
<LI><b>8888</b> - overrides the draft with the preferred service (the character is still treated
as having been drafted, but the preferred service is chosen).
<li><b>9999</b> - overrides the enlistment roll, forcing enlistment to the
selected service (no draft).
</ul>

<h2>muster</h2>
<p>
This option allows guiding the mustering out process. The default process is to
make up to three cash rolls before rolling on the material benefits table.
<ul>
<li><b>ship</b> - don't roll for cash until a ship is acquired if possible
<li><b>TAS</b> - don't roll for cash until Travellers' is acquired if possible
<li><b>special</b> - combination of above
<li><b>split</b> - alternate cash and material benefits rolls (until mmaximum
number of cash rolls have been taken).
<li><b>any other value</b> - default behavior of taking cash rolls first.
</ul>

<h2>maxcash</h2>
<p>
This option allows specifying the maximum number of cash rolls to make. It may be
set anywhere from 0 to 3 or even higher (setting it higher is considerd "cheating").

<h2>hunt</h2>
<p>
This option is a real timesaver. It lets the system re-roll characters until it
finds one that meets the specfied criteria.
<ul>
<li><b>ship</b> - keep rolling characters until a ship is acquired
<li><b>TAS</b> - keep rolling characters until Travellers' is acquired
<li><b>special</b> - keep rolling until ship or TAS is acquired
<li><b>skill</b> - keep rolling until skill is acquired. Note that this
option is currently a bit limited. Skills that are multiple words can not be
searched for.
</ul>

<h2>level</h2>
<p>
When used with hunt=>skill, specifies the minimum level of skill sought.

<h2>vehicles</h2>
<p>
This option allows customization of the skill tables to meet specific versions of
Classic Traveller. The changes all surround the vehicle skill. The default is
The Traveller Book.
<ul>
<li><b>1977</b> - Use the 1977 vehicles (ATV and Air/Raft), Merchants get Strength +1 instead
of vehicle and Other gets Forgery instead of Vehicle.
<li><b>1981</b> - Use the 1981 vehicles (Vehicle cascade, except Air/Raft for Army, Merchants Strength +1
replaced with Vehicle, Other Forgery replaced with Vehicle)
<li><b>any other value</b> - Default as per The Traveller Book. Note this is a mish-mash between 1977
and 1981.
</ul>

<h2>personal</h2>
<p>
This option controls when the Personal Development table is used. The default will not use the
Personal Development table if Education is 8+.
<ul>
<li><b>always</b> - The Personal Development table is always available.
</ul>

<h2>cascade</h2>
<p>
This option allows leaving cascade skills for the player to determine after the fact. For benefits,
it will distribute the benefit as a weapon and then add to the cascade skill. Verbose history can be
used to unwind if the player wants to take multiple weapon benefits.
<ul>
<li><b>skip</b> - Leave cascade skills to be determined later.
</ul>

<h2>minterms</h2>
<p>
With this option, the generator will not accept a character
that musters out with less than the specified number of terms. It also
assures the character doesn't voluntarily muster out before that time.
The default is 1, and if left at default, will still allow deceased
characters.

<h2>maxterms</h2>
<p>
With this option, the generator will limit the maximum number
of terms for a character to the specified amount. Mandatory
re-enlistment will not be checked for characters that hit the limit
(this allows a GM to specify the maximum age of PCs or NPCs).

<h2>maxchars</h2>
<p>
This option will limit the maximum number of attempts to
find a requested character. The default is 10000 and bounds the time
spent attempting to generate a requested character.
