<H1>Water Tower</H1>

<P>
Here is the water tower I built using the curved wall using the technique Erik Brok shows
<A HREF="http://homepages.svc.fcj.hvu.nl/brok/legomind/models/">here. Go to "Buildings" and then "Curved Walls".</A>
<P>
Notice all the roof detail, including a lamp to alert aircraft. My city obviously has a
bustling communications industry. Notice the cell phone company man up on the tower, obviously
he was just servicing the cell.
<P>
I need to work out a good safety cage for the ladder to satisfy OSHA. Also, the instalation
either needs a perimeter fence, or some kind of gate preventing people from climbing the tower.
I should also play with modifying the walls to try and put a class year on the side.
<P>
These two photos also show some camera techniques. The 2nd picture was taken using
a slave flash unit placed out of the view to the left. Notice that not only are there
fewer shadows, but there also isn't as much glare. A 3rd flash on the right, or possibly
slightly more carefull arangement of the 2nd flash would eliminate even more shadows.
