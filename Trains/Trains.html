<P>My special interest in trains is logging railroads. I love Shays, Climaxes, and Heislers.
These engines are all geared locomotives.

<P>The Shay was the most popular geared locomotive. Shays have two or three vertical
cylinders mounted on the side of the engine.  These power a driveshaft which runs the
length of the engine along the side.  Every axle is driven.  Between the universal joints
in the drive shaft, and the ability of the trucks to swivel, the Shay has a great deal of
flexibility which is an advantage when traversing poor temporary track laid through the woods.
Another advantage of the Shay over normal rod steam engines is that if a tender is added for
additional fuel and water capacity, the truck or trucks on it are also driven.
This means that the weight of the fuel and water adds to the tractive ability of the engine.

<P>Heislers have two cylinders in a V2 configuration, driving a center drive shaft.
Again, the drive shaft powers all axles, and great flexibility is achieved.

<P>Climaxes have two cylinders mounted diagonally on the side of the engine.
They drive a centered drive shaft, similar to the Heisler.
