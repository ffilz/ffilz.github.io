<H1>THE GREEN MENNACE (aka The HMS Squished Bug)</H1>
<P>
This ship starts with a hull from 6250, but doesn't follow much else (I
think I sort of followed the first couple of steps [not even exactly, I
substituted black 2x4 bricks for the underside, why waste grey bricks where no
one can see them?]). This ship has been outfitted for Evil Steve's Pirate
Game. It has two cannon and a crew of 12 on board.

<H1>THE RED SEAS BARRACUDA</H1>
<P>
I used 6289 Red Beard's Runner hulls, but basically followed the 6285 Black Sea's
Barracuda instructions. I modified the gun deck to hold 3 cannon, and moved
the upper deck gun port so a cannon could actually be fitted there. I also
worked on the cabin, and especially set it up so another cannon can be fitted
in there. This is all to get the 5 broadside cannon the pirate game allows. I
had hoped to use dark grey almost exclusively, unfortunately, there were many
dark grey parts I just couldn't find, or ran out of. I need to get more red
1x10 plates so I can make the spars red (I broke open 6 Axe Carts to get the
1x4 plate with rod, note that I used this instead of the 1x2 plate with rod so
that the spars are studs up so pirates can stand on them, I'll be modifying
all my older ships to studs up spars).

<H3>Here's More Construction Information</H3>
<P>
This weekend I finally sat down and started on my "Red Seas Barracuda".
My original intent for the RSB was to use Red Beard Runner hulls, and
build a ship using the BSB directions but using dark grey instead of
black as much as possible, and red instead of yellow, and green trim.
<P>
<H4>Some discoveries I made:</H4>
<P>
In my parts bins, I have a pretty good selection of dark grey except:
<UL>
   <LI>NO 1x2 bricks
   <LI>NO 1x3 plates
   <LI>very few 1x6 plates
   <LI>NO 1x10 plates
</UL>
<P>
I knew I was going to have a problem with the 1x2x3 inverse extreme
slopes used in the window frame.
<P>
What I ended up doing because the limitation of dark grey was to put a
white band around the windows and make the poop deck railings white
(perhaps the captain's parrot has been taking the term poop deck a
little bit too much to hear?). Once I did this, I realized that I had
definitely made the right choice in leaving the white band along the
hull (by my original plan, I actually should have made that green).

<H4>I made some modifications to the ship:</H4>
<UL>
   <LI>The gun deck has 3 gun ports on each side (part of my motivation is to
       run Steve Jackson's Pirate Game, a BSB size ship will mount 7 cannon,
       with the side firing cannon being able to be moved from side to side as
       I understand - this is something I'm not absolutely clear on).
   <LI>I moved the masts so those platforms on the side which mate with the
       ratlines line up properly (the bracing there is supposed to support the
       mast stays in a real ship).
   <LI>I moved the gun port just fore of the rear cabin forward one stud so a
       cannon can actually use it.
   <LI>I decked over the bow area, and have mounted two cannon on swivels.
   <LI>I lowered the rear windows a bit (which helps line up the colors
       better the way I did the white band), and modified the inside decking of
       the cabin so that a cannon can be placed in the cabin and fire out any
       of the windows)
   <LI>I put a trap door in the floor of the cabin.
   <LI>I enclosed the areas under the 4 trap doors on the main deck so that
       cargo (or prisoners) can be put in there without having to play "shake
       the coin bank to get the money out".
</UL>

<H1>CUTTERS</H1>
<P>
I have built several ships based on the small ship in
<A HREF="http://guide.lugnet.com/set/6277">6277  Imperial Trading Post</A>. These ships are
called <B>cutters</B> in the Pirate Game. Here are some pictures:

The Red Vulf (left) and the Black Vulf (right), along with the merry band. These are actually
built for my castle theme, but they will find service in the Pirate Game also. The sails were
made by Sheree Rosenkrantz.
