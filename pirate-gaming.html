<H1>SHIPBUILDING FOR THE PIRATE GAME</H1>
<P>
For people who would like to work on ships, some things to think about
(The following includes some extractions from the rules at
<A HREF="http://sj.sjgames.com/PirateGame1.html">http://sj.sjgames.com/PirateGame1.html</A>)
for my games:

<P>
Ships and boats are divided into <B>Classes</B>, based on size:

<UL>
   <LI><B>0:</B> Boat (a canoe, rowboat or sailboat, or longboat) 
   <LI><B>1:</B> Cutter (which, in my own fleet, includes a lot of
                 different little ships that are not really "cutters," from
                 miniature square-riggers to sloops). A cutter is a small
                 custom-built hull. A more precise definition may be needed.
   <LI><B>2:</B> Brig, or regular ship with no center sections. A brig is a
                 larger custom- built hull. Again, a more precise definition is
                 needed. Or maybe not. 
   <LI><B>3:</B> Regular ship with 1 center section, or wide ship with no center sections. 
   <LI><B>4:</B> Regular ship with 2 center sections, or wide ship with 1  center section. 
   <LI><B>5:</B> Regular ship with 3 center sections.These "schooners" are rare. 
   <LI><B>6:</B> Wide ship with 2 center sections. 
   <LI><B>7:</B> Wide ship with 3 center sections. 
   <LI><B>8:</B> Wide ship with 4 center sections. These are rare.
</UL>

<P>
A ship's class determines:

<OL>
   <LI>How many guns it can carry. The number is equal to its class. 
   <LI>How many hull hits it can take: 10 times its class, with a minimum of 1. 
   <LI>How many rigging hits it can take: 5 times its class, with a minimum of 1. 
   <LI>Whether there is a bonus or penalty to hit it with cannon fire.
   <LI>Starting crew in the Battle Game (6 per class)
</OL>

<P>
Per Steve's communications, every ship has at least one rotating cannon
mounted on the deck or so. Larger ships have 2-3 rotators. The maximum
number of broadside cannon (firing through a gun port) is 5 (to get 5
broadside cannon on my red/white/dk grey modified BSB, I had to put a
cannon in the captain's cabin - this cannon can also fire out the
stern).

<P>
I would suggest the following for numbers of rotating cannon (note the
overlap in class ranges):

<UL>
   <LI>1 rotator on class 1-4
   <LI>2 rotators on class 4-7
   <LI>3 rotator on class 7-8
</UL>

<P>
In general, rotating cannon are more flexible (though there may be
situations where a similarly placed broadside cannon could be brought to
bear when a rotator can't since a full broadside may be fired at any
target that at least one of the broadside cannon can hit).

<P>
Broadside cannon may be moved from side to side. The rules aren't clear
on if this takes time or not. I need to clear up a few issues like that
with Steve. Moving the cannon from side to side may be accomplished by
any of the following means:
<UL>
   <LI>Simply moving the cannon from side to side (ala 6285)
   <LI>A slider/rotator (ala 6289)
   <LI>Putting one cannon on each side (when a cannon is destroyed, both cannon in
       such a pair must be removed or marked destroyed)
</UL>

<P>
We will also need some merchant ships, which generally will be smaller.
Many of these will be cutters. I talked with Steve once about making
custom built class 3 ships, and he said that it would be reasonable to
make those with the 10 wide hull sections (make a 10 wide ship which is
a little longer than a 12 wide ship with 1 center section). Brigs should
be similarly sized to a 12 wide ship with no center sections (6268,
6250), these should be wider than 6 wide (Steve uses inverse slopes to
widen a 6 wide hull to 8 wide). Short 10 wide ships would be reasonable
for brigs also.

<H2>Potential New Cannon Rules</H2>
<P>
I'm tempted to revisit the cannon rules. One thought is to have one
broadside cannon per center hull section, plus one (i.e class-1 for
12-wides), and have the advantage of 16-wide ships be that they get 2
swivel mount cannon on the foredeck, and have cannon on both sides, so
if there are targets on either side, they get a LOT more shots than a
12-wide. This would give 16-wide tubs (no center sections, class 3)
generally the same firepower which can be brought to bear on a single
target as currently allowed (though as 2 swivels and 1 broadside instead
of 2 broadside and 1 swivel), and the larger ships one fewer cannon, but
the large ships would have a huge advantage in fleet actions, and would
also be able to replace lost cannon (say 1 turn to move a cannon from
one side to the other - though that would still be a free move on a
12-wide, though perhaps requiring two crew).

</UL>

<P>
(FF) Some general thoughts on the game:

<UL>
   <LI>Note that the game was developed as a game mastered game, so the rules
       have some imprecision.

   <LI>The game also has a primary purpose of fun as opposed to simulation

   <LI>A game master has an obligation to try and make the game fun for the
       players, this involves balancing the conflicting needs of "rules lawyer"
       players and "hey I just want to sail my ship around, role play a bit,
       and shoot up some Imperials" players.
</UL>

<P>
<B>(RR) It says that the ship can turn once at the beginning of its movement.
What if you want to move 6", turn, then move 6", does it take extra crew
actions for this?</B>

<P>
(BS) Yes.

<P>
<B>(RR) If you didn't use the free turn in the beginning, can
you apply it in the middle of your move?</B>

<P>
(BS) No.  The purpose is to allow you to change course based on the events as
they stood at the end of the previous game turn.

<P>
<B>(RR) It says all damage is simultaneous during combat. Does that mean ALL
combat, or each type of combat?  For instance, if a pirate is shot by a
cannon, does he still get to fire his musket? Or if a pirate is killed
by a musket, can he still attack with his cutlass?</B>

<P>
(BS) Hmmmm, well, I handled cannon fire during ship movement, then resolved
minifig combat.  Part of this is answered below.

<P>
(FF)Yes, the two types of combat are distinct. Each phase is taken in turn,
and all activity within a phase is simultaneous.

<P>
<B>(RR) If a sailor needs to move to accomplish something like loading a
cannon, does he get to move and load the cannon in the same turn, or
does his movement count as his action during the turn and he'll load it
next turn?</B>

<P>
(BS) Kinda grey - movement isn't specifically listed as an "action".  At the same
time, boarding combat specifically says you can move and fight.
Significantly, the other actions don't list movement.  I would think not for
cannon.

<P>
(FF) Note that movement is during a separate phase from cannon fire or small
arms fire, though crew is allowed to move 1" to dodge cannon. I'd be
inclined to allow crew within 1" of a cannon to man the cannon.

<P>
For my own game, I will be doing some thinking about cannon. I've been
thinking about changing how many cannon are allowed etc. So I will
probably revisit this. I do want to end up with less complex rules if at
all possible.

<P>
(SB) Depends... It says in the rules to ignore the placing of figures during
ship-to-ship combat (i.e. the captain doesn't need to be by a cannon to fire
it, you don't need 4 crew in the rigging etc.). In boarding actions however
it's a different manner. In this case I would say that any crew member not
by a cannon in the cannon firing phase, can't contribute to the firing of
that cannon (although the 1" rule mentioned here seems fine to me, but I run
my games a little loose in distance interpretation anyway).

<P>
<B>(RR) If a sailor wants to be 'prudent' (aka jump overboard on a sinking
ship) does he need to declare that as his action during the turn, or can
he fire a musket and then jump before the hull damage phase?</B>

<P>
(BS) Move and fight, fight and move.  Since there aren't any reload rules, I'd
probably opt for not allowing movement and firing, but as the rules stand, I
would think you can.

<P>
(FF) Based on the phasing, movement comes before small arms fire, so I would
say "being prudent" is a movement action.

<P>
In fact, looking at the phasing, I'm inclined to move crew movement to
before cannon fire (hmm, no, just changed my mind). Part of me also
wants to require some of the sailing crew to be aloft, but I'm not sure
how to handle this, and not all ship models can actually have crew aloft
(though I'm converting ships to studs up spars, I finally completed my
first SES which has been languishing for over a year without spars and
sails - not only did I do her with studs up spars, but she also got red
spars, I also finally fitted out the Red Seas Barracuda with her red
spars - thanks everyone who traded me red 1x4 plates with towball).

<P>
I think the purpose of putting crew movement after cannon fire was to
allow the crew phases to be skipped if they didn't matter much due to
distance between ships.

<P>
<B>(RR) When a cannon is close to 'crossing the T' of another ship, is the
attacking player required to take the crossing the T minus to hit in
exchange for two damage rolls? Or can they decide which way they want to
play it? If they have multiple cannons, could they choose differently
for each?</B>

<P>
(BS) The ship does not magically turn sideways, so no, you shouldn't have a
choice.  You have a narrow target but if you hit it, the ball is going to
travel along the length of the ship, creating havoc.

<P>
(FF) Here's a thought for a pretty simple rule for determining if you're
crossing the T. From the cannon closest to the enemy ship, trace a
straight line the direction the cannon is pointing. If the line crosses
the curved portion of a bow or stern section and exits the ship in a
different hull section, you are crossing the T. This actually amounts to
just about 45 degrees to either side of the centerline, so perhaps
that's the best rule, though that seems a bit restrictive, on the other
hand, it also fits the compass points. So, I'm inclined to make the
simple rule stand. Another simple rule would be 22.5 degrees to either
side of the center line. This also is a reasonable measure to use since
it fits with how you determine which compass point your ship is on in
gauging wind effects.

<P>
(SB) Nope, you have to take the -2 (which is due to the way a boat's hull is
angled to deflect shots). IIRC, rigging and deck shots aren't at any penalty
though...

<P>
<B>(RR) A player doesn't want his ship to move, but hasn't dropped anchor.
However, he doesn't want to spend any crew actions sailing so all of his
guys could shoot their muskets. I say at this point the referee gets to
move the ship according to the unmanned ship rules. My friend who didn't
want his ship to move, pointed to the rule saying you can just let the
wind slip from your sails. Who is right?</B>

<P>
(BS) He has left the ship to drift.  The rule about spilling wind is if you are
actually moving (and have commited at least some crew to sailing).  Without
some sort of "way" (movement through the water) a ship had no control
("She's not answerin' the 'elm, Cap'n!").  If he's just flapping his sails,
he's at the mercy of the tides, current, and wind.

<P>
<B>(RR) Tactical Question - It seems to us after playing, that its vastly
more effective to always aim at the deck and never bother with
grapeshot.  It takes forever to do enough hull or rigging damage to make
them worthwhile.  Grapeshot is just to risky and doesn't do enough
damage to justify the risk.  I could see where in a campaign game if you
were just trying to escape another foe that rigging shots could be worth
it.  Do you think we just aren't following the rules properly?</B>

<P>
(BS) I'm not sure I agree with the results that you get from the rules as it
stands, so I tend to feel it is a matter of balance.  Historically, shooting
up the rigging (a favorite French tactic) didn't work that well in actually
winning a fight.  If the other ship had carronades (short range cannons that
throw heavy shot), or I was trying to sail away, I'd think about it.
Grapeshot was something you only really used prepatory to boarding (or
preventing such).  Hull shots: it wasn't that easy to sink a wooden ship
quickly.  But I'm not sure that aiming at the hull and the deck was
something that was that precise.  You could aim low, hoping for a below
waterline hit, but you caused the most casualties with solid shot by hitting
the hull (flying splinters).  I'm in favor of combining the two charts for
solid shot.

<P>
(FF) Per <A HREF="http://news.lugnet.com/fun/gaming/?n=419">lugnet.fun.gaming post 419</A>
Steve Jackson himself admits that the damage charts are flawed. He indicated he would like
to encourage more hull shots.

<P>
(SB) Rigging shots are useful if someone's outrunning you and you want to
capture the ship intact... Deck shots are useful when closing to board (esp.
if using grapeshot) and Hull shots are good for ranged battles with a ship
you don't particularly want to capture (Warships mainly), especially if you
outgun your opponent...

<P>
<B>(SB) Why is there a -6 to hit with Grapeshot - it fires out of the cannon in
a cone, so it's pretty hard to miss at close-ranges. Wouldn't a harsher
range-modifier be better?</B>

<P>
(SJ) We've tried several things. I'm still not happy.

<P>
(SB) I decided on a -1 penalty to hit with grapeshot for every 6" you are
from your target. It seemed to work pretty well...

<P>
<B>(RR) Hull Damage - I'm pretty down with this now, except for *when* you roll
for possible hull damage for sinking.

<P> 
First quote from the rules:

<P>
<I>When a ship is down to 20% of its hull
hits, it begins to take on water, which has the effect of adding more
hull hits! Roll a die at the beginning of every turn that a ship is at
or below the 20% level (shown on record sheet). On a 1, 2 or 3, one more
hull hit is taken.</I>

<P> 
Second quote from the rules:

<P>
<I>(7) Damage control. After damage
control, assess new hull damage caused by existing hull damage or by
fire. Remove any ships sunk by this new hull damage.</I>

<P> 
Step 7 is clearly not at the beginning of the turn, yet it says that's
when to "assess new hull damange caused by existing hull damage" which I
can only surmise to be sinking damage.  So when is the proper time?</B>

<P>
(FF) I'd be inclined to say do it at Step 7. The only thing between Step 7
and Step 1 is shark activity. It just means you lose one turn of
swimming away from sharks if you suddenly find yourself in the water as
the ship goes down.

<P>
<B>(RR)
So, a Class 1 Cutter starts with 12".  Its first hit is ignored, so its
still 12".  The second hit goes to 11", third to 10", and fourth to 9".
Ack! The example says 8" for the fourth?!  The example for the Class 3
ship just says 'loses an inch', but doesn't tell us the end result so
that doesn't help.</B>

<P>
(FF) In programming parlance this is the common "off by one" error. The
cutter goes from 9" to 0" on it's last hit.

<P>
<B>(RR)
Hand to Hand - The rules indicate there are actually three separate
phases for H2H combat, but the separate Turn Phases document has
combined the Musket & Pistol phases. Quote:

<P>
<I>(5) Individual combat. Muskets first, then pistols, then other
weapons. A hit is a kill; all dead pirates fall into the sea.</I>

<P>
Quote from Turn Phases document:

<P>
<I>"Anyone have musket or pistol fire?"</I>

<P>
If Muskets indeed get their own phase first, this makes them vastly
superior over Pistols, since the pirates killed in the Musket phase will
not get a chance to shoot back with their Pistols.   (I think everyone
agreed that combat damage is only simultaneous if it occurs during the
same phase.)</B>

<P>
(FF) I'm sure this is a result of simplification. When I ran, I ran all small
arms fire simultaneously.
