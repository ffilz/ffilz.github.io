<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+4>Frank Filz's Gaming Briefcase Challenge</FONT>

<p>I've talked before about what print RPG materials I would keep if I had to downsize. I mentioned recently that I could even manage to fit a collection into a briefcase, so I actually tried to do that and this is the result.

<p>A while ago, I did an exercise where I decided to see what I could fit into a briefcase (actually a laptop bag - the briefcase I used to use for gaming would have held more):

<br><A HREF="https://ffilz.github.io/images/IMG_2138.JPG"><IMG BORDER=0 ALT=Image SRC=https://ffilz.github.io/images/IMG_2138-small.JPG></A>

<p>I spent about 15 minutes collecting this together, with more time, I would refine it. I really would like a bit more RQ material, and I really should have some graph paper, lined paper, and blank paper in there. There are also some bits I would print off from my computer, and maybe a few other campaign bits I would try to squeeze in. I'd alsqo squeeze in a bit more Traveller stuff.

<p>Now if I just had to fit this into my backpack instead, all of that would be easy since I would be able to fit about twice as much stuff.

<p>So what is here:

<ul>
<li>OD&D plus the first three supplements
<li>Judges Guild Wilderlands (all the setting booklets, map 1, a poster sized map of all 18 maps with hex grid on one side, no grid on the other)
<li>City State of the Invincible Overlord
<li>First Fantasy Campaign with a TSR color map from the DA modules
<li>Module B1 Into the Unknown
<li>Ready Ref Sheets and Campaign Hexagon System
<li>Burning Wheel Gold and Burning Wheel Codex
<li>Traveller Books 1-3
<li>RuneQuest 1st ed, Cults of Prax, and the map from Troll Pak
<li>Campaign folders for The Wine Dark Rift Traveller, Wilderlands OD&D, and Burning Blackmoor, and a miscellaneous folder with cool stuff in it
<li>A bag of dice and pencils
</ul>

<p>The picture of the briefcase (actually a laptop case) includes a Traveler DVD case for size comparison, that CD ROM is not actually in the contents.

<p>Now why does all of this matter when I have almost everything in digital form? In one sense the print stuff doesn't matter, but I'm a tactile person, plus I think the stuff one displays on one's shelf helps others understand you. So if I had this stuff tucked into my cubby in some hypothetical tiny living situation (maybe a shared 4 dTon Traveller stateroom), someone would get an instant idea of what I would plan on doing with my time.

<p>Now the meaningfulness of this exercise changes somewhat if a laptop is included and we get to have all the PDFs we want. In that case, of course, PDFs or scans of everything!

<p>Still, to me what is interesting about this exercise is contemplating what I REALLY care about for gaming material. Sure, there's loads of gaming stuff I "might" use someday... I think my thinking about this exercise even before I actually did it really helped me focus my gaming. I'm paying attention to the games I really want to play, and purchasing stuff (mostly PDFs these days) that really support that rather than just buying the latest fancy thing.

<p>Really this exercise was an offshoot of having to downsize my collection after getting engaged. I ruthlessly downsized then (I do regret some stuff I got rid of, but not much) and am still working on downsizing some of the stuff (still have like 6 milk crates of stuff I'm trying to sell).

<p>In the meantime, an incomplete list of physical stuff I've purchased since getting engaged:

<ul>
<li>Burning Wheel Magic Burner, Adventure Burner, Gold, Codex. Torchbearer, Middermark. Burning Empires. Mouse Guard RPG. (can you see a theme here...)
<li>Classic Traveller CD-ROMs, GURPS Traveller Ships CD-ROM
<li>Mongoose Traveller (1e) hardcover
<li>The Seclusium of the Orphone of the Three Visions (I saw it in a store, I like Vincent Baker, I might draw from it for OD&D gaming)
<li>The Adventurers Handbook (a variant of BRP included in a book on role playing games)
<li>Dungeon board game (found for a pretty reasonable price at Powells Books)
<li>I think that copy of B1 was picked up since getting engaged.
</ul>

<p>I think there's really just a few other items beyond the above list.
