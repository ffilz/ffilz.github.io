<H1>BELVILLE</H1>
<P>
Belville is one of two doll oriented LEGO product lines. Belville scale is similar to the
Technic figures, but uses more articulated and realistic looking dolls. Colors tend to be
pale or pastel variants of system colors. The dolls still have somewhat of a LEGO feel. The
hands hold rod pieces just like minifigs. There are children and a baby (the baby is a single
piece). The belville children are about the right size to pilot the UCS X-Wing.
<P>
Structures are build from some large parts (large lattice parts in the earlier sets and a
semi-circular tower in the newer sets). Only one set uses a baseplate, all others use
either the 8x8 base bricks, or 24x24 base bricks with quarter circle cut out of one corner,
and the matching 12x12 quarter circle piece. These pieces used to be limited to Belville
until a green 24x24 base brick was used in 5987 Dino Research Compound.
<P>
Furniture tends to be built of bricks, or use the 2x4x4 and 4x4x4 cabinets from the early
homemaker sets.

   <LI>Brad Hamilton has made several minifig creations which make extensive use of Belville parts:

<H1>SCALA</H1>
<P>
Scala is the other doll oriented LEGO product line. Scala dolls are more comparable to Barbie
in size and detail. The hands still hold rods like minifigs (this is one nice feature of all
the non-DUPLO LEGO scales, every one of them which have hands is capable of holding rod items
(though the big bendyarm folks don't have an open clip, so the set of items they can hold is
limited). There are children and also a baby. The baby is a single piece.
<P>
Only a few sets use baseplates. The other structural sets use a Scala unique system which 
uses 22x44 and 44x44 floor parts (which are about 2 bricks thick), tall frames which support
upper floors, walls which fit between the columns in the frames, and shorter columns (6 bricks 
high) and wall pieces. The walls have vertical tracks which several shelves, picture frames,
and other bits can be attached to.
<P>
There is also a special Scala "stud" which is flower shaped.
The stud pitch is twice that of a normal system stud, but the shape allows 2x by 2y bricks and
plates to attach (the tube fits into a slot in the center of the stud). 1x1 round bricks and
plates (and a few other parts) can also fit in the center of the stud, or between two studs.
<P>
NEED PICTURE OF STUDS AND HOW PARTS CONNECT...
<P>
Furniture uses a variety of pieces. There are 3x6x6 and 6x6x6 cabinets, chairs, high chairs,
a 3 sided box piece (which is used for easy chairs, cribs, dog beds, and more), and a few other
bits.
<P>
IN the 2000 sets, new thin foam pieces were introduced. These pieces are used as shrubery
(with a special slotted brick to hold them vertically), pine tree leaves (layered effect
using 1x1 cylinders as trunks and a new part which fits into holes in the foam), and various
things like hambuger patties and cheese. See the review of 3159 below for more discussion of
these new parts.
