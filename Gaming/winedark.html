<p>This is a Traveller campaign where the PCs are mostly ex-military or had other interesting previous careers,
all having mustered out on the same world, or having made their way there. One of the characters
in a group probaly has mustered out with a ship, but if not, there are options to acquire a ship, or even just
travel from world to world looking for adventure. The characters will seek out patrons, look for damsels in
distress, find alien ruins to loot, try to take over worlds, find fortune through piracy, or anything else
that the players might want to do. The key is that the PCs are group of people restless with the confines
of imperial society and have found their way to the frontier to seek fame and/or fortune.

<p>The Wine Dark Rift is a region of space at the edge of the Imperium (not to be confused with The Third Imperium from GDW's setting).
the Imperium has grown over large and it's ability to project itself out on the frontier is not what it could be. In fact, there are
worlds outside the Imperium that used to be more under the control of the Imperium. In this region, patrols are few and piracy is
definitely a concern. Due to the low frequency of patrols, pirates most often prey on commerce at the larger starports. Outside the
Imperium is a large number of worlds to explore. The rift poses a barrier to travel with almost no ships capabable of better than
Jump-2 out here on the frontier. Even the imperial worlds must be self sufficient as communication back to the Imperium core takes so
long and resources are so scarce. This leaves lots of room for adventuresome souls (travellers) to go out and make their own mark.

<p>See the map at the bottom of the page for a larger map and a link to the "sub-sector" map (the region is actually two
standard Traveller sub-sectors PLUS an additional few hexes in each direction.

<h2>RULES</h2>

<p>I will be using Classic Traveller 1977 Books 1-3 (with some text taken from 1981) along with some house rules:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YEPiaXQZoWbvnrHohrB5U7iLrzmT4HGplGrLxusIhl0/edit?usp=sharing">House Rules</a>
 - Includes character generation and equipment notes.
</ul>

<p>There are four versions of Classic Traveller (1977 and 1981 boxed sets, The Traveller Book, and Starter Traveller),
and any version can serve fine as a reference for play. From a player perspective, which version of the rules you have
will not be of too much concern. The changes to character
generation from 1977 to 1981 are minor and any version is acceptable. My house rules document indicates what changes have
been incorporated (but don't worry, if you rolled using 1977, you will be just fine, if appropriate, I'll have you roll
some additional skills and if you achieved Rank 5, and additional mustering out benefit). The house rules document also
shows how the weapon damage has changed. Everything else is stuff that will be dealt with as we play (and most of the rest
of the changes that may or may not be incorporated affect GM procedures).

<p>Having a copy of the rules is not absolutely necessary, but ff you don't have your own set of the books, I suggest one of the following paths to acquire a copy if you desire:
<ol>
<li>Get the Classic Traveller CD-ROM from here: <a href="http://www.farfuture.net/FFE-CDROMs.html">Far Future Enterprises CD-ROMS</A>
<li>Get FFE 0000 The Basic Books 1-3 from here: <a href="http://www.farfuture.net/hardcopy.html">Far Future Enterprises Hard Copy Reprints</A>
<li>Get Deluxe Traveller from <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/80191/CT-DTDeluxe-Traveller">RPGNow</a> or
<a href="http://drivethrurpg.com/product/80191/CT-DTDeluxe-Traveller">DriveThruRPG</a>
<li>Get The Traveller Book from <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/80192/CTTTBThe-Traveller-Book">RPGNow</a> or
<a href="http://drivethrurpg.com/product/80192/CTTTBThe-Traveller-Book">DriveThruRPG</a>
</ol>

<P>Characters generated using Supplement 4 - Citizens of the Imperium are also possible, however, as called out in the
house rules, I have modified the skill tables:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kS3h7JgF6CniH851034zBX0aPT-MhIggUO0yE_y0Jao">Supplement 4 Alternate Skill Tables</a>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>PLAY STYLE</h2>

<p>I have been taking
a lot of Christopher Kubasik's ideas to mind (and the other folks who have also been posting in the same vein), so reading his blog
(<a href="https://talestoastound.wordpress.com">Tales to Astound</a>)
will be useful for getting a feel for where I cam coming from. Jeffro originated the term Proto-Traveller to label the idea of
using the original three books as a basis for play. Many of us who follow that movement incorporate bits from other
sources, but the goal is the game contained in the original three books.

<p>Here is a starter blog post that may help in understanding
the style of play I hope the game will run with:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://talestoastound.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/traveller-out-of-the-box-making-a-character-playing-to-find-out/">
TRAVELLER: Out of the Box–Making a Character, Playing to Find Out</a>
</ul>

<p>I do want to emphasize some aspects of play that are relevant so we are all on the same page of expectations:
<ul>
<li>Play of the game actually starts with character generation, and you character can die during the process of previous
experience. This should be embraced. But the previous experience system can also be used to tease out something about
your character. Finally, the character generation system right from the start highlights that Classic Traveller is a game
of playing to find out. We start by finding out who your character is. As we play, we will play to find out what happens to
your character. Death is a constant risk. Success and failure are always in play. Your character may or may not change the
universe. While I have links to some automated character generators below, I strongly encourage players to actually pick
up the books and a set of dice and roll them up by hand.
<li>Characters have skills, but they should not be considered a limitation on what the character csn do. They provide the
character opportunities to overcome odds and succeed. Background and characteristics of the character, as well as what the
character has accomplished may also be leveraged to succeed.
<li>The setting is NOT the Third Imperium from GDW. The alien races are probably different (even if I borrow one from the
GDW materials).
<li>The setting of play is a frontier area. Travel is uncommon and dangerous. The PCs, "Travellers" are folks cut out of
stronger cloth than the average person. They have wandered away from the core of the Imperium for reasons that are up to
you as a player, to seek fame and/or fortune, or perhaps just to run away.
<li>The setting is characterized by the implied setting of the books, technology follows the books with occasional exceptions
introduced by me. It's helpful to consider the 50s and 60s pulp inspiration for Traveller and the 1977 introduction of the game.
Don't balk at room sized computers or the lack of blasters and light sabers.
<li>The setting is a sandbox. I have some ideas of what is going on, but there is lots to discover. It's your game as much as mine,
so ultimately we will work together and I hope something exciting will emerge from play.
</ul>

<p>I will leave it up to
the players to add more definition as to why they know each other, but I think that should be a given (or if someone is unknown the
group, the players have primed things so we don't play the "we all meet in the bar and get into a fight). I'm assuming someone will
muster out with a ship and the group has an interest in exploring the sandbox and figuring out what they can make of it (trade,
trying to find a world to exploit, just wandering, whatever).

<p>Automated character generation resources if you don't have the means to roll up your own characters:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~ffilz/Gaming/travellercharacter.html">Classic Traveller Character Generator<a>
 - This page links to my latest version of the generator with documentation of the options.
<li><a href="http://devilghost.com/software/travellercharacter/?history=verbose">Original Classic Traveller Character Generator</A>
 - This page will roll a character up for you, you can hit refresh a few times looking for one you like. Cut and paste and e-mail or otherwise post to me.
<br>What is here has been fixed, but may not have the latest enhancements I have added.
<li><a href="https://github.com/pgorman/travellercharactergenerator">Source for Classic Traveller Character Generator</A>
<li><A href="http://blog.jochenlinnemann.de/?page_id=82">Classic Traveller Java Character Generator</A>
- This one is not as convenient as the first (you have to download and run it locally), however, it does allow making choices.
<li><a href="http://games.softpedia.com/get/Tools/Traveller-Character-Generator.shtml">Traveller Character Generator</A>
- This is a Windows app that allows choice. <A href="http://rabsoft.co.uk/itemtravellercharactergenerator.html">Here's another link with a screen shot</A>,
however, this binary did not work on Windows 8 64 bit.
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-008gy5YLjlR24xR2Vkdmw3ZzQ/edit">Character Generation Tables</A>
- This is a Google Sheet with all the tables for Classic Traveller. For my campaign, if subject to the draft, you should just roll 1d6 for Navy, Marine, etc.
(assume the 1st die on the draft table in that sheet is 1 or 2). Of course if you use one of the Citizens careers, you need to use my skill tables.
</ul>

<p>
Another option for character generation if you don't have the rules, or don't want to play the mini-game yourself: Give me a few specs on what
you would like to play, and I will roll up a few characters for you attempting to meet your desires. If you give too many specs, I will likely
not be able to meet them all (or even come close)... No specs is fine also, I'll have fun rolling up a few characters and you can pick the one
you like the best.
