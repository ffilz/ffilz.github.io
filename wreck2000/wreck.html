On August 17, 2000 on my way into work I was rear-ended by a large SUV (I think it was a Ford Explorer). Here are some pictures taken the next day when I went to the salvage lot to collect what personal belongings were salvageable that I hadn't got out right after the accident.

<P>
What is most amazing is that I came out of this accident with just a few scrapes and bruises, and a few sore muscles (so far as I know currently). The accident occured in stop and go traffic. I had got somewhat ahead of the SUV in the left hand lane and then was stopped. The next thing I knew, I was seeing the gaurd rail coming at me, though everything was almost stopped (but you will be able to see from the damage that I did hit the guard rail with some force). Apparently the SUV got locked to my car, because both of us spun almost 180 degrees. I escaped by rolling down the unbroken passenger's side window, and crawling out over the guard rail.

Here you can see the car from the driver's side. You can get a little bit of an idea of how shortened the car was from the tailpipe. You can see why Tracy thought the accident she saw wasn't mine because the car looked like a Honda CRX not an Acura Integra. From the passenger side, the resemblance to a CRX is somewhat more pronounced. Of course the front end of all Hondas (and Acuras) look awfully similar.

Here's what it looks like from the back. Notice the unbroken tail light bulb!
Here's the passenger side. When I went to the salvage yard to get stuff out, I was able to unlock the door and open it. The bumper sticking out the window was tossed in after the accident. My slightly abused souvenier bat bumper magnet is now on the back of my rental car. That dash of red is one of the clips of my jumper cables which were in the spare tire well.

Just after taking this picture, I opened the passenger door to get stuff out of the car! It only had a little trouble opening.

Here you can see more detail of the inside from the driver's side. Notice the rear seat which got pushed through to the front. The rear seat backs were sheared away. Had there been any passengers in the rear seat, I think they would have been scraping them up with a spatula. I was thrown somewhat towards the center of the car (probably a good thing). When the car came to a rest, my head was leaning against that rear seat (who knows, the seat may have even stopped me from being thrown around so badly). Notice that the steering wheel cover came off, who knows where it went (but every piece which goes flying is taking energy with it away from people - assuming it doesn't hit someone - this principle is why race car drivers have hit the wall at over 100 mph and walked away from the crash, those tires bouncing down the track are carying a significant portion of the energy of the vehicle).

The chap on the other side of the car is the owner of the towing company. He was quite nice and friendly and helped me extract stuff from the car (though since it was 4:30 on Friday and he still had a car to tow, you can understand his desire to help get me on my way faster).

Here's an inside detail shot from the passenger side.
