Colin and Wanda finally surfaced in Cary North Carolina. Actually, it's a
pair of clones. When they arrived a couple months ago, I
was just too busy to do much, so I quickly found all the parts to clone them
and saved them aside. Tonight I decided to do a photo
shoot.

I had to build one of my 1775s so that I had a passenger plane for them to
arrive on! They took a day at the beach, then visited an
old English fort, and a couple pirate ships. Finally, they took a trip to
space and flew at the head of a fleet of Spyrius ships,
and got to play with the Blacktron Challenger and Invader. While tooling
about in the Blacktron ships, a pair of Space Police
cruisers tried to pull them over, but Wanda, flying the Invader, scored a
direct hit on one of the police cruisers!

I wanted to do more combat shots, unfortunately, it looks like the batteries
have gone dead in my slave flash controller so I'll
need to get more batteries. By aiming it towards the camera, I got a pretty
decent fireball effect, but I'd like to work on it more.
As a 2nd picture, I tried to place some LEGO bricks around the police cruiser
to look like blast wreckage, unfortunately, the slave
flash wouldn't fire. The red cast to the picture is a result of putting a
trans-red canopy in front of the slave flash.
