<H1>Kirielle of the Eagle Rock Tribe</H1>

<H2>Cards:</H2>

<H3>Booster Pack #28:</H3>

<P>
This image shows Kirrielle, her brother Letan, and her mother
fleeing the city which she was born in during a war.  Her father
is Prefect of the South Ward.  Her mother and father came from
different spheres.  Kirielle, Letan, and their mother fleed to
mother's home realm, Eagle Rock.  Kirielle was 6 at the time,
her brother was 7.
<H3>Booster Pack #36:</H3>

<P>
This image shows a ship that the family travelled on in their
journey to Eagle Rock.  A great storm blew up, and Letan was washed
from the ship and lost.
<H3>Other Worlds: Michael Whelan II Card 61 (The Stone of Farewell
- sec. A):</H3>

<P>
This card came from a Michael Whelan card set.  The artwork is
the back cover of Tad Williams' &quot;Stone of Farewell&quot;
and shows a tall rock jutting from a lake.  Birch trees in the
forground frame the picture.  The scene is winter.  The rock is
Eagle Rock, home Kirielle's mother's people.  Kirielle's mother
died when she was 11.
<H3>Booster Pack #2:</H3>

<P>
This image shows Kirielle.  The cat is her special companion.
 Many people of the tribe have special companion animals, though
not all are cats.  The wand allows Kirielle to speack with animals.
 The feather headdress is used in a ritual to see visions.  The
cat is Snow Paws and is male.  In Kirielle's language, there are
MANY words for snow, I haven't decided exactly what type of snow
Snow Paws is named for.  Note Snow Paws' large feet.
<H3>Booster Pack #32:</H3>

<P>
This card shows Kirielle's father and the city.  Note the cat
accomanying her father.  Though he does not have quite the same
companions as people of the Eagle Rock tribe, he still has a special
affinity for cats.  This is what attracted Kirielle's mother to
her father.  An additional significance of this card is that her
father is still alive, and the city survives.
<H3>Standard Pack V/37:</H3>

<P>
This card shows Letan.  As Kirielle has not yet found her brother
again, the significance of this card is not yet known.  Note the
strong cat motifs though.
<H2>Game Statistics:</H2>

<H3>Motive: Mystery</H3>

<P>
Kirielle is searching for her father and brother.  She is also
just plain interested in just plain understanding the universe.
<H3>Virtue: Priestess (normal)</H3>

<P>
Understanding Mysteries: Kirielle is quite in touch with the spiritual.
<H3>Fault: The Satyr (normal)</H3>

<P>
Indulgence: Kirielle indulges herself.  Note the decoration of
her clothing, and WOW that headdress!  Note also that Kirielle's
powers require the use of objects.
<H3>Fate: The Unicorn</H3>

<P>
Purity/Temptation: Will Kirielle be overwhelmed by her fault,
or will she over come it?  Who knows what else her fate might
have in store for her (thats what the game is all about after
all).
<H3>Powers:</H3>

<H4>Speak With Animals (0):</H4>

<P>
The need of the wand, Kirielle's Water score, and her Virtue combined
to allow this to be cost 0.
<H3>Snow Paws (3):</H3>

<P>
Snow Paws is of child intelligence, and can talk to Kirielle.
 Snow Paws is 3-Fire, 3-Earth, 2-Air, 5-Water.  Snow Paws is better
than a Cat Familiar, though not as good in combat as a Wolf Companion.
<H4>Visionary Ritual (2):</H4>

<P>
This is straight from the book.  Kirielle's headdress is important
in these rituals.
<H3>Elemental Scores:</H3>

<H4>Water: 7 (Swimming):</H4>

<P>
Kirielle is VERY water aspected (note her powers and virtue).
 Note also the boat  voyage and the lake around Eagle Rock.
<H4>Air: 3 (Story Telling):</H4>

<P>
A bit of indulgence here...
<H4>Fire 2 (Dancing and Partying):</H4>

<P>
Here's some more indulgence!
<H4>Earth 3 (Tireless Stride):</H4>

<P>
Kirielle travels quite a bit.
<H2>Additional Thoughts:</H2>

<P>
I was amazed how well Kirielle evolved.  Everything just fits
so nicely.  I did not envision her as really being a magician,
though she did have some ability to do magical things with her
wand and headdress.  For a while, I tried to give her magic. 
In the end, she works out quite well with a few powers and a high
water score.  There are several campaign hooks possible with her.
